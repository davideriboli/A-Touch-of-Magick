# A Touch of Magick
*Touchdesigner resources*

Ever since I discovered and started using Touchdesigner, I have lost interest in any other creative coding framework.

TD is very complex, but luckily there are a lot of great tutorials out there, made by great coders. The main collection is that provided by the AllTouchdesigner site (http://alltd.org/).

This repository collects the toes and toxs files that I generate by following the tutorials that interest me most, my creations and other resources publicly distributed via the web.

All materials are published under the MIT license and each file contains comments indicating their origin and any author. If any of them disagree with this publication system, can easily contact me to request the removal of your contributions or a change of license.
