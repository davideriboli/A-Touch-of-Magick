INGREDIENTS

01_VideoIN
Video device in (enough said...).

02_Cache
Used to generate a retard in the video signal.
Check the negative "Output Index" parameter.

03_Difference
Used to have a difference composite tween video-in and its cache.

04_Chromakey
We use Chromakey to separate the subject from the background.
In parameters tab "Val", play with vals to adjust chromakey to your signal. 

05_Feedback
Used to dramatize the trails effect in loop with the next ingredient.

06_Composite
Used to dramatize the trails effect in loop with the prev ingredient.
Play with the "Operation" options menu in the first parameters tab to have a lot of different real time effects.

07_Level
Connect it tween 05 and 06 if you need more control on your final output.
With "Level" you can correct brightness, gamma and so on.

08) Out (enough said...). Add a "Syphon Spout OUT" to transmit to Madmapper, Resolume or similars.
